Use npm i all 
in both frontend and backend folders to install all dependencies for frontend and backend

in the backend folder, make sure to change the MONGO_URL in .env file. I have used my own MONGO DB atlas for this project.
You may change it accordingly

Now start the backend
go to backend folder
execute npm start

then start the frontend
go to frontend folder
execute npm start

The blog application will be started
